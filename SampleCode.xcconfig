// The `SAMPLE_CODE_DISAMBIGUATOR` configuration is to make it easier to build
// and run a sample code project. Once you set your project's development team,
// you'll have a unique bundle identifier. This is because the bundle identifier
// is derived based on the 'SAMPLE_CODE_DISAMBIGUATOR' value. Do not use this
// approach in your own projectsâ€”it's only useful for sample code projects because
// they are frequently downloaded and don't have a development team set.
SAMPLE_CODE_DISAMBIGUATOR=${DEVELOPMENT_TEAM}

// This should then be used in the Info.plist
//PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=com.example.apple-samplecode.${PRODUCT_NAME}${SAMPLE_CODE_DISAMBIGUATOR}
